# Webservcies-Python-Flask

RESTful Web Service is an architectural style, where the data or the structural components of a system is described  in the form of URI ( Uniform Resource Identifier) and the behaviors are described in terms of methods. The resources can be manipulated using Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations. The communication protocol for REST is HTTP since it suits the architecture requirement of being a stateless communication across the Client and Server.

I have used Python Flask to implement web services.

I have used student data which is in json format and have successfully performed all 4 methods:
1.) GET -> to retrieve data
2.) PUT -> to update existing data
3.) POST -> to store data
4.) DELETE -> to delete record

I have tested the webservice using Postman.
